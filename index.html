        <p>Chapter 2026 is the last chapter of Helena Sun's college undergraduate journey. We will discuss the 
          various experiences and accomplishments that precede her graduation in June, 2026. Throughout this chapter, 
          we will explore what makes Helena click and hint towards what comes after receiving her B.S. in Computer Science.

            Helena Sun is a 4th year student at the University of California, Irvine pursuing a Bachelor 
            of science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Her specialization is in Architecture 
            and Embedded Systems. As an undergraduate student, Helena has explored various fields of computer science, 
            such as machine learning, embedded systems, data structures, algorithms, user interface design, and networking.
            However, she is most fascinated by hardware and low-level computer organization that supports the ever-growing 
            software demands, especially with the ubiquitousness of AI.<br>
