        <h3 class="subheading">Personal Interests</h3>
        <p> Helena has two desires on her mind all the time: video games and a little treat (mostly in the form of milk tea).
            These two inanimate passions are what keep her through the sunshines and rainstroms of her college journey. 
            Let's take a closer look at what exactly make Helena click.
        </p>
        <h5>Milk Tea</h5>
        <p>Helena loves floral and fruity milk teas. Although creamy is considered a rich taste by most,
            Helena finds it too heavy and strong. Add-ons such as boba and jelly are chosen carefully 
            for most orders as they might stir the flavor of the tea itself.

    <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
        <h5>Video Games</h5>
        <p>Fast-paced combat action gives Helena the most dopamine and adrenaline.</p>

                <h6>Ultrakill</h6>
                <p>Ultrakill is Helena's favorite game of all times. It's a low-res fast-paced flashy game of a robot with guns.
                    The robot, V1, can parry almost any attack and has an ability where it shots at a coin and have its bullet 
                    ricochet right into the enemy. Ultrakill also has a deep horrific lore involving humanity, religion, and existentialism.<br><br>

                <h6>Hollow Knight Silksong</h6>
                <p>Hollow Knight Silksong is another of Helena's favorite due to its fast-paced combat. Helena loves the first 
                    Hollow Knight game, and the sequal only made her love the series more. The world building, lore, art, and music
                    are awe-inspring. Helena listens to Hollow Knight and Silksong soundtracks when she needs to focus on work.<br><br>

                <h6>Overwatch 2</h6>
                <p>Overwatch 2 is a team-based shooter game that Helena plays casually with friends. Overwatch 2 is very
                    attention intensive, and Helena can lose herself in the game for hours. Currently, she is enjoying playing
                    as Hanzo, a bow-wielding character.<br><br>
