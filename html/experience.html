            <p > Helena loves "side quests" or activities that seem unrelated to her main academic path but looked fun. 
            Here are some major positions that she has took on over her undergraduate years, many of which can be found 
            with more detail in her resume. <br><br>A little fun fact: Helena landed her first (and only) internship partially because of 
            her "side quest" as a Resident Advisor! <br><br>
            </p>
