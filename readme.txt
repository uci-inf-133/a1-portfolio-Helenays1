--Readme document for Helena Sun, helenays@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- Multiple images with descriptive alt attributes
- Appropriate headings h1-h5 and paragraph text
- Links to external pages
- Multiple pages with creative navigation between them

(b) CSS features
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
- Modifying text color to be visually appealing
- Leverage Bootstrap CSS helper for table layouts

(c) Advanced features
- Creating a more complex page two column layout that collapse to one based on screen size and navigation section
- Leveraging nested selectors to specify format, especially with p tag

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
The accessibility provided a few potential problems relating to potentially my alt text does not convey the same information as the picture or should be empty. This should not be the case. 
Most other problems are similar. They ask me if I am using the header correctly, naming the links correct, etc. These are not really warning I believe, more like reminders.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
Designing - 30 minutes
Prototyping/playing around - 1 hour
Each page - 1 hour x 4 = 4 hours
Styling - 1.5 hours
Total - 7 hours

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
I do not have all the links I clicked on while making my website, but here are some I digged up from my histroy. They are mostly from W3 School or Stack Overflow.
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28704432/how-to-change-background-image-based-on-screen-size-possibly-with-bootstrap
https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_br.asp
https://icomets.org/wh/chap02.pdf (I tried to make my website like this textbook!)

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
None


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Nope! Have fun learning about me.
